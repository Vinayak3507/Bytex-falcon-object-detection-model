# Project Overview  
This project was developed as part of the **HackBeyond Falcon Object Detection Challenge**.  
We trained a YOLO-based object detection model using **synthetic data generated by Duality AI's Falcon digital-twin simulation platform**.

Our objective was to accurately detect various objects found inside a space station environment under challenging lighting, clutter, and orientation conditions.

# Model Description  
We trained a YOLO-based detection model on the provided synthetic dataset using the following pipeline:

### Model Architecture  
- YOLOv8-based detection  
- Anchor-free architecture  
- Fast inference suitable for real-time edge deployment

### Dataset  
- Falcon synthetic dataset  
- Multi-class object detection scenario  
- Includes oxygen tanks, fire extinguishers, laptops, emergency kits, tools, wall panels, and more

### Training Configuration  
- Mode: `yolo detect train`  
- Optimizer: AdamW  
- Epochs: 50  
- Learning rate schedule: cosine  
- Losses tracked: box_loss, cls_loss, dfl_loss  
- Validation after every epoch
